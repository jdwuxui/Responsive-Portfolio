            <p>I grew up in the outer suburbs of New York and moved to Florida to attend college. After earning an advertising and design technology degree I began my career as a graphic designer in the large format printing industry. I worked as an art director for a small design studio specializing in vehicle wraps and trinsitioned into a marketing director and creative director position for the 22nd largest staffing company and its 22 sister companies.</p>
                    
            <p>The year 2011 made its way around and I accepted a position working with a youth football organization doing UI, UX, visual design, and copywriting.</p>
